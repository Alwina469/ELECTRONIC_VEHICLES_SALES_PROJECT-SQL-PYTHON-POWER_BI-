## INTRODUCTION

The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is reshaping the global automobile industry, and India is no exception. 

With increasing environmental concerns, government incentives, and a shift towards sustainable transportation, analyzing EV sales data is crucial for understanding market trends, infrastructure needs, and business growth opportunities.

This project provides a detailed data analysis of EV sales in India using MySQL for data preprocessing, Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Power BI for visualization.

##  PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project follows a structured data analytics workflow:

- ### **Data Collection & Import**

Imported the dataset from a CSV file into MySQL Workbench.


- ### **Data Cleaning in MySQL**

1. Created a staging table to work on cleaned data while preserving raw data.

2. Performed data cleaning steps:
     Removed duplicates.
     Standardized categorical values.
     Handled null values.
     Removed unnecessary columns.

   


- ### **Feature Engineering in MySQL**

    Added Quarter Column (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).

    Added Day of the Week Column (Monday–Sunday).


- ### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Jupyter Notebook**

     Identified key trends in EV sales over time, by region, and vehicle type.


- ### **Power BI Dashboard for Visualization**

     Built an interactive dashboard with 4 pages covering sales overview, detailed analysis, and growth trends.

 ## RESULTS AND INSIGHTS

 1. **Total EV Sales Growth Over the Years**

- EV sales in India have grown exponentially from 2,392 in 2014 to 1.5 million in 2023.
- Biggest sales jump: 2021 to 2022, where sales tripled.

INSIGHT: EV adoption is accelerating, signaling a shift towards sustainable mobility.



 2. **EV Sales by Month & Day**

-  November & October recorded the highest sales, suggesting demand surges during festive seasons (Diwali, year-end discounts, etc.).
-  Wednesday had the highest sales—possibly due to mid-week purchasing patterns.

INSIGHT: Businesses can plan marketing & stock replenishment around peak demand days.



 3. **Top & Bottom Performing States**

-  Uttar Pradesh leads India’s EV sales, followed by Maharashtra & Karnataka.
-  Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Nagaland have the lowest adoption rates.

INSIGHTS: Targeted subsidies & infrastructure development in lower-ranking states can boost adoption.



 4. **EV Sales by Vehicle Type**

-  2W_Personal (Two-Wheelers) dominate the market with 1.79M sales.
-  3W_Shared (E-Rickshaws) contribute heavily to last-mile connectivity.

INSIGHTS: This confirms that two-wheelers and electric rickshaws are driving EV adoption in India.



 5. **Best-Performing States by Growth & Sales Percentage**

-  Uttar Pradesh contributes 20.37% of total EV sales.
-  Maharashtra & Karnataka follow with 11.17% and 8.77%, respectively.

INSIGHTS: Investing in EV infrastructure in these high-growth states can accelerate adoption.
